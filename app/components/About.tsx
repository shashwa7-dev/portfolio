        Hey there! I’m Shashwat—a curious builder and problem solver who loves
        turning ideas into elegant digital solutions. With a knack for crafting
        sleek interfaces and seamless user experiences, I’m always on the
        lookout for new challenges. Lately, I’ve been diving deep into the
        fascinating world of AI and machine learning, exploring how they can
        shape the future of technology.
